# CVAT-DATAUP: Enhanced Computer Vision Annotation Platform

**CVAT-DATAUP** is an enhanced version of the popular open-source Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT), featuring new capabilities and an improved user experience while maintaining full compatibility with existing CVAT instances. It provides a modern interface, advanced annotation tools, an integration with AI agents. Beyond annotation, the next open-source release of CVAT-DATAUP will introduce powerful data-driven capabilities such as automated dataset processing, dataset versioning, quality assurance pipelines, model-in-the-loop evaluation, and agent benchmarking. These enhancements elevate CVAT-DATAUP from a traditional labeling platform into a comprehensive environment for managing the full lifecycle of data-centric AI development ‚Äî from curation and annotation to validation, deployment feedback, and continuous improvement.


## üöÄ What Makes CVAT-DATAUP Special

- **ü§ñ Agent Support**: Leverage intelligent agents for data processing and automation üîú
- **‚ö° Pipeline Architecture**: Design customizable pipelines for scalable data processing üîú
- **‚ú® Enhanced Annotation Experience**: Improved UI/UX for faster and more intuitive annotation 
- **üîÑ Full CVAT Compatibility**: Seamlessly work with existing CVAT projects and data
- **üìä Advanced Analytics**: Better insights into annotation progress and quality

## Built on CVAT Foundation

CVAT-DATAUP is based on the robust foundation of [CVAT](https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat), the industry-standard annotation tool used by tens of thousands of users and companies worldwide. We've enhanced it with cutting-edge features while preserving all the reliability and functionality that makes CVAT great.

## Quick start ‚ö°

### Installation

CVAT-DATAUP can be deployed using Docker Compose for easy setup:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cvat-dataup.git
cd cvat-dataup

# Start the application
docker-compose up -d
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

- [CVAT FAQ](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/faq/)

## ü§ñ Agents üîú

CVAT-DATAUP introduces intelligent agents that extend beyond traditional annotation workflows:

- üîó**Seamless Integration**: Connect with public AI agents (visible to everyone) or private/self-hosted agents restricted to your organization.
- ü§ñ **Auto-Annotation**: Use agents to accelerate annotation by automatically labeling data based on learned patterns.
‚úÖ **Quality Assurance**: Employ agents to validate and score annotations, improving dataset reliability.
- ‚ö° **Data Processing Pipelines**: Incorporate agents into end-to-end pipelines for transformation, filtering, or enrichment tasks.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Custom Agent Development**: Build and deploy domain-specific agents tailored to your workflows.

*Note: Agent functionality is currently in development and will be available in future releases.*

## ‚ö° Streamlined Data Workflows with Customizable Pipelines üîú

Pipelines in **CVAT-DATAUP** are built by chaining modular steps ‚Äî these steps can be **AI agents**, **data processing tasks**, or **integrations with external systems** (e.g., databases, storage, or model APIs). This flexible design makes it possible to automate complex workflows, from raw data ingestion to final dataset export.

- **üîß Pre-processing Pipelines**: Data cleaning, preparation, and augmentation before annotation  
- **üñäÔ∏è Annotation Pipelines**: Structured annotation flows that ensure consistency and efficiency  
- **‚úÖ Post-processing Pipelines**: Automated validation, quality control, and export of processed data  
- **‚ö° Custom Pipeline Builder**: A visual interface for designing and deploying pipelines tailored to your needs  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Pipeline functionality is in active development and will be available in future releases.*


## üîÑ Full CVAT Compatibility

**CVAT-DATAUP** is fully compatible with existing **CVAT** deployments, ensuring a smooth transition without breaking workflows:

- **üì¶ Project Migration**: Import and continue working with your existing CVAT projects  
- **üóÇÔ∏è Data Format Support**: All annotation formats supported by CVAT remain fully compatible  
- **üîå API Compatibility**: Existing CVAT-based integrations work out of the box  
- **üì§ Export Compatibility**: Annotations can be exported in standard CVAT formats  

If you already have **CVAT** installed, migrating to **CVAT-DATAUP** is straightforward.  
In addition to applying the database migrations, run the following command inside your CVAT server container:

```bash
docker exec -it cvat_server bash -ic 'python3 ~/manage.py populate_dataup_uuids'
```


## Prebuilt Docker images üê≥

CVAT-DATAUP provides prebuilt Docker images for easy deployment:

- **cvat-dataup/server**: Enhanced backend with agent and pipeline support
- **cvat-dataup/ui**: Improved frontend with modern interface

All images are based on the proven CVAT architecture with additional enhancements.
